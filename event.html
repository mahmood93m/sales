      <h2>The International Society for Universal Dialogue</h2>
      <p>
         The International Society for Universal Dialogue was founded in Warsaw, Poland in 1989. ISUD is a philosophical society dedicated to promoting international and intercultural dialogue among an ever-wider segment of humanity. The main purpose of the society is to pursue, by means of scholarly work, the gradual realization of a decent, peaceful, and just world order. Towards this goal, ISUD produces biannual international conferences to facilitate an ethos of universal dialogue. ISUD is committed to promoting philosophical discourse intended to encourage the emergence of a more decent and humane world order by promoting dialogue to actualize the highest and richest human values in all dimensions of life. ISUD is a member of the International Federation of Philosophical Societies (FISP), is an international association of philosophers and scholars from a wide range of other disciplines (such as history, archaeology, pedagogy, anthropology, etc) devoted to promoting the discussion of such fundamental issues as world peace, social justice, human rights, and dialogical interrelations of diverse cultures.

      <h2>Pawel Kuczynski: Artistic Videographer of ISUD</h2>
      <p>Pawel Kuczynski is the director and producer of many documentary and fiction films. He received his PhD from the prestigious Polish Films School in Lodz, Poland.
      In 1991, Pawel began to systematically document the intellectual and moral ethos of the International Society for Universal Dialogue. His efforts to record the intellectual life of the society have produced a rich library documenting key moments of ISUD World Congresses as well as the deliberations, lectures, and interviews with society members. Through these intellectual and artistic efforts Pawel has established himself as ISUD’s “artistic videographer.”
      His 2004 film, “Philosopher’s Paradise” focuses on his personal relationship with his father, Janusz Kuczynski, Founder of ISUD. His 2007 film, “Light Denied” blends documentary and fiction film while including a variety of ISUD members—both in personal interviews and as characters interacting with fictitious characters to elucidate the ideas of Frederick Nietzsche. His 2008 film “Phenomenology of Truth” also includes ISUD members. More details concerning Pawel’s work can be found at http://delosfilms.com.
      Pawel’s works in progress include a film tentatively titled as “Philosophical Friends, The Story of a Dream.” This film depicts the legacy of his father’s relationship with his friend and colleague Jens Jacobsen while re-counting two decades of ISUD efforts to present its vision of a more humane world through the activity of inter-cultural dialogue. </p>
